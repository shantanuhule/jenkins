every time when you stop the instance of sonar the ip changes and while building a job in jenkins it will create an error so go in:
manage jenkings>> system>> and change the IP in sonar qube server



# remebmer to change the sonarqube server ip in jenkings
# and the jenings ip in sonarqube weebhooks
